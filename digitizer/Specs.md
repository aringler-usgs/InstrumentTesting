# Digitizer Specifications


## Background
A number of seismometers and accelerometers used by the USGS require their output be digitized.  This digitized data then gets sent to one or more data centers for processing.  The high-dynamic range of many broadband sensors and accelerometers makes it necessary for the digitizers to also have a similar dynamic range.  Beyond the dynamic range communication with the digitizer as well as information on the state of health of sensors is necessary.  Currently many broadband sensors are designed to be controlled through a digitizer so additional communication ability is also necessary. 

## Basic Operations

## Specifications

### Digitization
Any modern digitizer should be capable of digitizing between three and six channels simultaneously with an accuracy of X.  Additional auxiliary digitization channels are also diesriable.
